Android-notify-lite: A replacement for the android-notifier-desktop
application, written in Go.

ANL requires the Remote Notifications application to be installed on your
android phone, and libnotify/notify-send installed on your computer. 

For now, it only works with the "Global Broadcast" option. 
Encryption works.
